## About This Project

This project was created as a learning experience to understand the process of building a website collaboratively within a team environment. Throughout the development of SCM-Project, team members worked together to plan, design, and implement various features, including responsive layouts, custom fonts, interactive UI elements, and accessibility considerations.

By dividing tasks such as UI design, CSS styling, and HTML structure, each member contributed to different aspects of the project. Regular communication and version control practices (using Git) were used to coordinate changes and ensure a smooth workflow. This hands-on approach provided valuable insights into teamwork, problem-solving, and the practical challenges of web development in a collaborative setting.
